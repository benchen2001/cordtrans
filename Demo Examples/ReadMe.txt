Run simple graphics user interface GUI_TryMe.py in the command line by 
entering following command in the Demo Example folder

../Demo Examples/>python.exe GUI_TryMe.py

Alternatively you can run the individual files in the Demo Example folder by 
executing the file name under python.exe

../Demo Examples/>python.exe Gyroscope-TeachDemo-1_Gyro_Cube_Motion_A.py

You can change gyroscope's parameters using the second method. For example open
Gyroscope-TeachDemo-1_Gyro_Cube_Motion_A.py file with an editor and you can edit 
the parameters of the gyroscope. Then run the python.exe again. The available 
parameters are listed in software documentation at the back of the technical 
note in the first link above.
